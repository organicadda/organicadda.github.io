<span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is said that ‘we are what we eat’. Organic
food is that food which is grown naturally. This is the food that our gods and
ancestors ate once upon a time. Unfortunately, today owing to various factors
the conventional food that is normally available in the market is grown with the
help of hazardous chemicals which are harmful for the body and the mother
earth. Chemical pesticides and fertilizers used in conventional farming deteriorate
our health and the health of the soil gradually. Solution to this problem is to
make a conscious choice of going organic which in turn will encourage farmers
to transition to organic ways of farming. As a facilitator, we are starting up
hangouts for better health through our organic marketplace called ‘Organic Adda’.
OrganicAdda (OA), at the outset, is an organic food market, with a vision of
creating an all pervasive e-store and healthy hangouts called “adda”. OA’s
products on offer will be:</span></div>
