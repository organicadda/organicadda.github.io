<h1>Welcome to Organic Adda - Your organic hangout place</h1>

It is said that ‘we are what we eat’. Organic food is that food which is grown naturally. This is the food that our gods and ancestors ate once upon a time. Unfortunately, today owing to various factors the conventional food that is normally available in the market is grown with the help of hazardous chemicals which are harmful for the body and the mother earth. Chemical pesticides and fertilizers used in conventional farming deteriorate our health and the health of the soil gradually. Solution to this problem is to make a conscious choice of going organic which in turn will encourage farmers to transition to organic ways of farming. As a facilitator, we are starting up hangouts for better health through our organic marketplace called ‘Organic Adda’. OrganicAdda (OA), at the outset, is an organic food market, with a vision of creating an all pervasive e-store and healthy hangouts called “adda”. OA’s products on offer will be:

    Fresh Organic vegetables and fruits.
    Organic groceries.
    Organic gardening implements. (Includes seeds, natural pesticides & fertilizers, terra cotta pots, saplings).
    Space on rent for growing their own saplings.

 

Through OA we will encourage society to not only eat organic but also grow their own food.
